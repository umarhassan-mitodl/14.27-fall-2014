There isn't really a good textbook for studying e-commerce, so coming to class and taking good notes will be particularly important. Some of the general economics topics I will cover in the beginning 

\[C&W\] = Church, Jeffrey, and Roger Ware. *Industrial Organization: A Strategic Approach*. McGraw-Hill, 1999. ISBN: 9780256205718.

\[PRN\] = Pepall, Lynne, Dan Richards, and George Norman. *Industrial Organization: Contemporary Theory and Empirical Applications*. Wiley-Blackwell, 2008. ISBN: 9781405176323.

I will not assign readings out of them. Rather, I suggest looking at them when economic models covered in lecture are not clear. There will also be newspaper and academic articles assigned throughout the semester, as well as required web surfing.
